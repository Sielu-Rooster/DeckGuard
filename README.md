# DeckGuard
The case that the Steam Deck comes with is... large, to say the least.  I have a nice bag to throw electronics in, but worry most about screens and joysticks... so I made a snap-on guard that protects the steam deck screen and joysticks!

This is designed to be printed on a resin 3D printer, in three pieces.  I was able to print vertically with no supports, although some playing with scale may be necessary to get an absolutely perfect fit.  The center 'puck' is intended to align the parts to be joined together using whatever method you find most appealing.  I just dripped some resin inbetween and cured it.  It was messy, but it functions.
